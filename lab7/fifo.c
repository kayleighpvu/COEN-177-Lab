    Title: Lab 7 â€“ FIFO
    Description: This program is in first in-first out order which puts the page into the cache is it is not there already
    and as we go through more pages and there are no more open spots in queue to put new page, the new page then replaces
    the page that is first in the queue/the page that has been there the longest.  At the multiple replacements happen, the page
    that has been there the longest moves to the first slot in queue.
